# Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispensor
Ultrasonic sensor is used  for the detection of the hand. The distance for detecting the hand can be easily set in the Arduino code based on your requirement. The Arduino will be repeatedly sending a signal to trigger the ultrasonic sensor and when your hand is present in front of the sensor then the sensor will output the total time taken by the sound to travel to and from the object. Then that signal is read by the Arduino. Based on that signal, we will be writing the code that when the sensor detects the hand it will turn on the hand sanitizer, and when the hand is not present in front of the sensor the hand sanitizer will be turned off. Servo motor is controlling the santizer to turn on or turn off.
